            <p>The secret side of me, I never let you see <br>
                I keep it caged but I can't control it <br>
                So stay away from me, the beast is ugly <br>
                I feel the rage and I just can't hold it <br>
                It's scratching on the walls, in the closet, in the halls <br>
                It comes awake and I can't control it <br>
                Hiding under the bed, in my body, in my head <br>
                Why won't somebody come and save me from this, make it end? <br>
                I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin <br>
                I must confess that I feel like a monster <br>
                I hate what I've become, the nightmare's just begun <br>
                I must confess that I feel like a monster <br>
                I, I feel like a monster <br>
                I, I feel like a monster <br>
                My secret side I keep hid under lock and key <br>
                I keep it caged but I can't control it <br>
                'Cause if I let him out he'll tear me up, break me down <br>
                Why won't somebody come and save me from this, make it end? <br>
                I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin <br>
                I must confess that I feel like a monster <br>
                I hate what I've become, the nightmare's just begun <br>
                I must confess that I feel like a monster <br>
                I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin <br>
                I must confess that I feel like a monster <br>
                I, I feel like a monster <br>
                I, I feel like a monster <br>
                It's hiding in the dark, it's teeth are razor sharp <br>
                There's no escape for me, it wants my soul, it wants my heart <br>
                No one can hear me scream, maybe it's just a dream <br>
                Maybe it's inside of me, stop this monster <br>
                I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin <br>
                I must confess that I feel like a monster <br> 
                I hate what I've become, the nightmare's just begun <br>
                I must confess that I feel like a monster <br>
                I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin <br>
                I must confess that I feel like a monster <br>
                I've gotta lose control, here's something radical <br>
                I must confess that I feel like a monster <br>
                I, I feel like a monster <br>
                I, I feel like a monster <br>
                I, I feel like a monster <br>
                I, I feel like a monster</p>
